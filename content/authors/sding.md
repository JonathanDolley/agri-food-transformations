I managed four research projects from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, ranging from rice farmers’ drought risk coping strategies, improved upland rice technology adoption and its impact on small scale producers, poverty and vulnerability of farm households in rural China, to livelihoods recovery of land-lost farm households in the process of urbanization in China. I have intensive experience in managing international collaborative research works. I coordinated household study work package of the research project from European Commission’s sixth framework programme for research (FP6) (Protecting the rural poor against the economic consequences of major illness: A challenge for Asian transitional economies), and several other international collaborative researches with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation. I provided consultancy services to the Shell Foundation, the World Bank Beijing office and FAO’s Bangkok office, on farm households’ renewable energy utilization, and estimation of potential use of crop residues for energy.
