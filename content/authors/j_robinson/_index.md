I am a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex. My background is in web development, the industry in which I have been working since graduating with an MEng in Computer Science from the University of Southampton in 2015. In 2019 I moved back into academia, and am currently working to develop software to aid research in sustainable & inclusive urban development.
