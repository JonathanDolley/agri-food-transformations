Shubham Mishra is an urban planner trained at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi and the International Institute of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), the Netherlands. He also holds a master’s degree in geography from the University of Delhi.

His interest lies in exploring landscapes – both built and natural – to link the present to the past. Most recently, it has translated into GIS mapping and designing of a tree database around the Humayun’s Tomb Complex for Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). In the past, he has provided planning/GIS support to Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the World Bank, Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence (CURE) and Forum for Organized Resource Conservation and Enhancement (FORCE) on issues centered on sustainable urban habitat. He plans to delve deeper into the use of digital technologies to visually depict the varied narratives that have and continue to make the urban.
