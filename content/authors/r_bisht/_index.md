Currently I am a Professor at the Centre for Social Medicine & Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University,New Delhi.From 2016â€“2018 I was the Chairperson of This Centre. Before joining I worked at the Department of Health Systems Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai where I was the Chairperson, Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management in the School of Health Systems Studies from 2004-2006. Besides teaching & researching, my work has involved engagement with policy makers and practitioners for policy & programme formulation and implementation. This has meant engagement with even China on sustainable development, nutritional security and community green house, learnings of which we brought for an intervention project in high altitude region of Ladakh in India. I have also worked with the PI Prof Fiona Marshall very closely for the ESPA project in Gaziabad district in India which is our current India case study site.
