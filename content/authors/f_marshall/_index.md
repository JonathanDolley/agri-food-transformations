My research is concerned with the role of science, technology and innovation in transformations to sustainability, and the characteristics of transformative science systems that will support balanced growth needs and inclusive development.  

I have a particular interest in ecosystem services, in food and agricultural systems and in the concepts, methodologies and practices of transdisciplinary action research (working across natural and social scientists and with public sector and civil society organisations). I have over 2 decades experience in the design, management and implementation of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and engagement initiatives in diverse contexts.

Much of my empirical work has been located in city regions and has examined the dynamics of the peri-urban interface and the impact of rapid social and environmental change on the livelihoods of poor and marginalised people. It has explored multiple interrelated dimensions of resource flows (and the food-water-energy nexus), environmental change, health and social justice in the context of  rapid urbanisation (particularly in South Asia). With an emphasis on initiatives to recast research policy and urban planning initiatives through a sustainability lens that combines environmental and social justice considerations and mechanisms for building resilience from below. This is exemplified in collaborative work to influence urban waste management policy and practice in India, and to integrate urban agriculture into development strategies that address multiple environmental and social goals.

I have worked on various aspects of food system resilience  - with a particular interests in adaptation to local environmental change and in International agricultural research strategy. In the UK I am the Sussex academic lead for the Partnerships in Sustainable Food Futures Interdisciplinary doctoral training centre led by the University of Greenwich and coordinated at Sussex through the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme.

I have lived and worked extensively overseas. At the University of the South Pacific, I examined benefits of intercropping for smallholder farmers; and at ICRISAT, In Hyderabad, India I researched resource partitioning in agroforesty systems. I have continued to work extensively in South Asia on food and agriculture systems, environmental pollution and peri-urban environmental change, and to undertake research and consultancy assignments in Eastern and Southern Africa and Latin America.

I have a BSc Hons degree from the University of Reading in Plant Sciences, and a PhD from the University of Nottingham in tropical crop ecology and environmental science. Before joining SPRU at the University of Sussex in 2004 (where I was Deputy Director and Head of Operations from 2005-2009), I was a lecturer in Agricultural Development at Imperial College London (1995-2004). Here I led research and policy engagement initiatives on the impacts of environmental pollution on agriculture and associated livelihoods, and established cross campus initiatives concerning International Development. Prior to this I worked in the NGO sector, initially as Overseas projects coordinator at the Henry Doubleday Foundation where she established an information and advisory service for sustainable agriculture initiatives in southern and Eastern Africa. As a consultant, again working across the research, policy and practice divides, I developed an integrated pest management support initiative for southern African NGOs, provided advice to the Stockholm Environment Institute (on assessing pollution impact in developing countries and on regional dialogues on socio-economic impacts) and to DFID on realising potential of research outputs from the Environment Research Programme.
