My research is concerned with the role of science, technology and innovation in transformations to sustainability, and the characteristics of transformative science systems that will support balanced growth needs and inclusive development.  

I have a particular interest in ecosystem services, in food and agricultural systems and in the concepts, methodologies and practices of transdisciplinary action research (working across natural and social scientists and with public sector and civil society organisations). I have over 2 decades experience in the design, management and implementation of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and engagement initiatives in diverse contexts.

Much of my empirical work has been located in city regions and has examined the dynamics of the peri-urban interface and the impact of rapid social and environmental change on the livelihoods of poor and marginalised people. It has explored multiple interrelated dimensions of resource flows (and the food-water-energy nexus), environmental change, health and social justice in the context of  rapid urbanisation (particularly in South Asia). With an emphasis on initiatives to recast research policy and urban planning initiatives through a sustainability lens that combines environmental and social justice considerations and mechanisms for building resilience from below. This is exemplified in collaborative work to influence urban waste management policy and practice in India, and to integrate urban agriculture into development strategies that address multiple environmental and social goals.

I have worked on various aspects of food system resilience  - with a particular interests in adaptation to local environmental change and in International agricultural research strategy. In the UK I am the Sussex academic lead for the Partnerships in Sustainable Food Futures Interdisciplinary doctoral training centre led by the University of Greenwich and coordinated at Sussex through the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme.
