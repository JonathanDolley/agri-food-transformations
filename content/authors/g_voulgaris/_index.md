I am currently an EPSRC funded PhD student and my project is focused on Autonomous Sensing and Sampling Drones for Water Quality Monitoring.

Prior to this, I worked as a Control and Automation Design Engineer for the oil and gas industry, where I was exposed to the full software and hardware life cycle, systems sensing and control, communications, project planning and management.

In addition, I designed and produced an automated greenhouse. The project was used as a platform that enabled me to conduct extensive research, whilst getting practical exposure to various aspects of the embedded software and hardware life cycle.
