I have a PhD degree in Social Medicine and Community Health. I have multi-disciplinary academic background from Policy Studies (Public Administration) to Health System Research. 
In 2004 I worked in a hospital as a Medical Laboratory Technologist for a while which gave me a wide exposure to learn and observe public health issues. This brought me interest to study Public Health Research.

Competence:
SPSS, NVIVO, QDAMinor, HyperRESEARCH, Dedoose, EXCEL
