This project contributes to the long-term well-being of urban and peri-urban residents by promoting the integration of formal and informal green infrastructure into city-region policy and planning in inclusive ways. An interdisciplinary team will work with communities, local NGOs and policy makers to develop a user-friendly application of deep learning techniques to city-region land-use mapping and build models and scenarios of land-use change. We will create a web-based tool that supports dialogue concerning the impact of current urban planning trajectories on green infrastructures, the environmental services they provide, and implications for well-being. It will incorporate information from the lived experiences and perspectives of poor and marginalised communities, alongside quantitative and qualitative data from other sources such as official statistics, academic literature and spatial datasets. The project will open up policy dialogues over alternative urban development trajectories that build on positive interactions between formal and informal green infrastructures.
