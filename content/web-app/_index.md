The development of a web-app for land-use change mapping and analysis was one of the core outputs from the project. This article provides a detailed description of the web-app's features and how these were used alongside fieldwork in Wuhan and Ghaziabad.

The Predictive Analytics Lab based at the University of Sussex were responsible for the technical development of the web-app and were also closely involved with team members in SPRU, JNU and ZUEL throughout the process of designing and testing the web-app. Their project page can be found here: [wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp](https://wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp) with a brief description and a list of development team members. A live demo of the web-app is available here: [landscapes.wearepal.ai](https://landscapes.wearepal.ai/).
