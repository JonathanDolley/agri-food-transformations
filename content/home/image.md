"**Inclusive Green Infastructures for Urban Wellbeing**" is an interdisciplinary research project funded by the [British Academy Urban Infrastructures of Well-being Programme](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/programmes/urban-infrastructures-well-being/). Our research explores the interactions between urbanisation and green infrastructures and implications for wellbeing in Wuhan, China and Ghaziabad, India. The project combines development of a web-app for land-use change analysis alongside fieldwork with peri-urban farmers and residents in the two cities.

This website presents details of the project and some of the outputs generated so far.
